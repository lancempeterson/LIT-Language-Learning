## Intro: What is Lost In Translation?

Lost In Translation aims to be the most effective language learning technique to get started in learning a foreign language. Learning a language to true fluency takes years of language acquisition and immersion. Getting started unfortunately, can seem like an insurmountable task. That is because in the beginning stages there is very little effective guidance.

Following the LIT plan won't make you 100% fluent. However, if you follow the steps laid out in the LIT plan, it will help move you from clueless to being a little bit less *Lost In Translation*.

As of now, I am only offering instruction for the beginning steps of learning the Japanese language. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

## LIT Japanese

**Lost In Translation - Japanese Language**

Welcome to the LIT plan for getting started with the Japanese language. Japanese can be a very rewarding language to learn! ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

**Simple Steps to Start**

A common problem that myself and many others have experienced in learning Japanese was that there was no structured plan to get started.

**Introducing the 5 Steps of LIT**

These steps can act as a scaffolding of sorts to set you up for a life of true immersion and comprehension of Japanese language. Each level includes a deck(s) of flash cards to be used in the Anki spaced repetition system. This is what I believe to be the most effective way to learn and retain a huge amount of information in your head.

At LIT 1 you will become familiar with the Japanese writing system with the Kana decks. Starting with LIT 2, you will begin the JLPT NX Decks.

For those not familiar: JLPT is a standardized series of Japanese language proficiency tests to evaluate and certify a specific level of ability. These tests go from N5 (being the easiest) to N1 (being the most difficult). The LIT plan only goes up to the the JLPT N2 level because after this point you should be spending most of your time reading, listening, and immersing in the language.
